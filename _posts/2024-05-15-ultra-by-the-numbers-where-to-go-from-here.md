# Where to Go From Here

Once an institution understands where they are regarding a move to the Ultra Course View, it needs to focus on four key areas that will help with change management process.

## Phased vs Cutover

Institutions can take one of two steps to move Blackboard courses onto the Ultra experience. One is a phased approach, moving content over by department, division, or by delivery method. Another approach is to migrate all Blackboard courses to the Ultra experience in a single term. This is commonly called a cutover approach. Here are the pros and cons of both options.

<th colspan="2">Phased</th>
<tr><td>Allows for comparative delivery analysis</td><td>Multiple course experiences could cause confusion for students</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ultra champions / instructors to fully experience UCV and share feedback to others</td><td>Instructors must retain workflows for both course views during transition</td></tr>
<tr><td>Increases knowledge and expertise in teaching / using Ultra Course View</td><td>Staff must support both instructors and students using both experiences</td></tr>

<th colspan="2">Cutover</th>
<tr><td>Clear delineation between student / instructor experiences</td><td>Requires everyone to be prepared for new course view / experience</td></tr>
<tr><td>Removes duplication of supporting two course experiences for instructors and students</td><td>Inability to confirm and/or test changes with students to ensure success</td></tr>
<tr><td>Allows separation of development for Ultra courses versus current course delivery</td><td>Communication and change management important to the success of this process</td></tr>

## Course Development

When moving to Ultra Course view, an institution can take many different approaches. These fall into normally three different categories - 

#### Developmental Course Shells - The institution creates course shells for instructors to develop new course materials in the Ultra Course view. Normally these should be available for a limited time during the migration from Original to Ultra.

#### Utilize Current Course Shells - The institution creates course shells
